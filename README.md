# ME210_CowShots
Software to be used for Teensy 3.2 to control the ME210 Mechatronics final Project.

## Typical usage
### clone repository (only do once)
Type the following into your terminal to clone the repository in the directory you want it to be saved
```bash
git clone https://github.com/srharris91/ME210_CowShots.git
```
This should download the desired files.

### typical flow to update and work on code
Type the following in your terminal after cloning the repo
```bash 
git pull
```
This will update any changes that have been made to the software while you were away.
Then make the changes you want to the code, test, verify, and once everything is working you can update the changes you made to the software by typing the following commands into the terminal at the right directory.
```bash
git add .
git commit
```
This will bring up a prompt where you can type a simple comment to the changes you made to the code (e.g.  Shaun updated IR sensors to sense the right frequencies)
Save and quit this file.  
Now you have updated the repository locally on your computer, now you need to update it to the GitHub repository.  To do this you need to type the following in the terminal.
```bash
git push
```

If you see errors in any of the following commands, then you may need to troubleshoot depending on the error.  Search the web!
